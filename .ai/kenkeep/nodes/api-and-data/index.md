# kenkeep Index: api-and-data

↑ Parent: [kenkeep](../index.md)

> kenkeep navigation: the injected body above is the root index node, the top-level catalog of branches and root-level leaves. Do not expect the whole knowledge base here; descend on demand. Read the root index node, pick one or more branches whose intent and tags match your task (several branches can be relevant), and read those branch `index.md` nodes. Descend further only where the task needs it, opening only the leaves you have confirmed are relevant. Follow each leaf's `relates_to` and `depends_on` cross edges to reach related leaves in other branches. You decide how deep to go per branch.

> This index only orients you; leaves hold the durable guidance. Open at least one relevant leaf before acting.

## Subfolders
- Load [`password-and-csrf-rules/`](password-and-csrf-rules/index.md) for more information on password rate limits, Retry-After and the CSRF header rule; read before adding a route that checks or sets a password, starts a session or writes.

## Conventions (how we build)
- Open [**JSON restore: idempotent, skips with reasons, keeps archive state**](practice-json-restore-rules.md) to learn about: importJsonExport skips records it cannot map with a reason, never replaces a running timer, and re-archives projects after task import. #server #import #restore #backup
- Open [**Project and task totals rely on the live-entry partial indexes**](practice-live-entry-indexes-back-project-and-task-totals.md) to learn about: Migration 2 adds time_entries_project_live and time_entries_task_live; totals SQL must keep using them. #server #database #migrations #performance
- Open [**Parse incoming timestamps with parseInstant**](practice-parse-api-timestamps-with-parseinstant.md) to learn about: Server input instants go through parseInstant: RFC 3339 with seconds and a zone, real dates only. Never new Date(String(x)). #server #validation #time #api
- Open [**Validate write-path references with getProjectRef and getTaskRef**](practice-write-paths-validate-refs-not-totals.md) to learn about: Entry and task writes check project/task references with the ref getters; getProject/getTask compute tracked totals. #server #models #performance #validation
- Open [**Deleting a client detaches its projects and never merges them**](practice-client-deletion-keeps-projects.md) to learn about: deleteClient runs in one transaction; projects lose the client and colliding names become "Name (Client)", then "Name (Client) N". #server #clients #projects
- Open [**Preferences: known keys validated, unknown keys stored verbatim**](practice-preferences-validated-by-known-key.md) to learn about: PREFERENCE_RULES in users.ts validates the keys the web app reads; other keys pass through; bad stored values read back as defaults. #server #preferences #validation
- Open [**Toggl CSV import: choose team-export users by opaque key**](practice-toggl-csv-import-selects-users-by-opaque-key.md) to learn about: Team CSVs list users by JSON key; send one user=<key> query param per user; a real multi-user import without one is a 400. #server #api #import #validation
- Open [**Validate hourly rates with optionalRate and MAX_HOURLY_RATE**](practice-hourly-rates-go-through-optionalrate.md) to learn about: Workspace and project rates share optionalRate, capped at MAX_HOURLY_RATE (1e9); a finite check alone lets reports overflow. #server #validation #reports #money

## Components (what exists)
- Open [**Users, roles and workspace membership**](map-users-roles-and-workspace-membership.md) to learn about: Migration 3 schema, createFirstAdmin, memberWorkspace and where it gates access, shared-workspace preconditions, and multi-user API test helpers. #server #database #migrations #auth #workspaces
- Open [**Admin API and disabled accounts**](map-admin-api-and-disabled-accounts.md) to learn about: /api/app/admin users, delete, invites and instance settings; public invite routes; last-active-admin rule; where disabled accounts are refused. #server #auth #admin #invites #settings
- Open [**Web app report endpoints under /api/app/report**](map-app-report-endpoints.md) to learn about: Web app reports are built server-side by /api/app/report/* with workspace rounding; only the summary tab fetches groupings. #server #reports #api #web

### #reports
- Open [**Web app report endpoints under /api/app/report**](map-app-report-endpoints.md) — Web app reports are built server-side by /api/app/report/* with workspace rounding; only the summary tab fetches groupings.
- Open [**Arrow keys: arrowTarget for roving tabindex; global shortcuts yield**](../web-ui-behaviour/practice-keyboard-arrow-keys-roving-tabindex-and-own-arrows.md) — Option groups move focus with arrowTarget and one tab stop; global arrow shortcuts skip defaultPrevented events and \[data-own-arrows\] targets.
- Open [**styles.css loads last and owns the colour tokens**](../web-ui-styling-and-layout/practice-styles-css-loads-last-and-owns-colour-tokens.md) — styles.css wins equal-specificity ties with page CSS, which uses its tokens and no colour literals.
### #admin
- Open [**Admin API and disabled accounts**](map-admin-api-and-disabled-accounts.md) — /api/app/admin users, delete, invites and instance settings; public invite routes; last-active-admin rule; where disabled accounts are refused.
### #backup
- Open [**JSON restore: idempotent, skips with reasons, keeps archive state**](practice-json-restore-rules.md) — importJsonExport skips records it cannot map with a reason, never replaces a running timer, and re-archives projects after task import.
### #clients
- Open [**Deleting a client detaches its projects and never merges them**](practice-client-deletion-keeps-projects.md) — deleteClient runs in one transaction; projects lose the client and colliding names become "Name (Client)", then "Name (Client) N".
### #invites
- Open [**Admin API and disabled accounts**](map-admin-api-and-disabled-accounts.md) — /api/app/admin users, delete, invites and instance settings; public invite routes; last-active-admin rule; where disabled accounts are refused.
### #models

### #money
- Open [**Validate hourly rates with optionalRate and MAX_HOURLY_RATE**](practice-hourly-rates-go-through-optionalrate.md) — Workspace and project rates share optionalRate, capped at MAX_HOURLY_RATE (1e9); a finite check alone lets reports overflow.
### #preferences
- Open [**Preferences: known keys validated, unknown keys stored verbatim**](practice-preferences-validated-by-known-key.md) — PREFERENCE_RULES in users.ts validates the keys the web app reads; other keys pass through; bad stored values read back as defaults.
### #projects
- Open [**Contrast tables in styles.css; project colours never paint text**](../web-ui-styling-and-layout/practice-contrast-tables-and-project-colours.md) — New colour pairs get a computed row in the styles.css contrast table. No opacity on text. A project hex only sets --project-color.
- Open [**Deleting a client detaches its projects and never merges them**](practice-client-deletion-keeps-projects.md) — deleteClient runs in one transaction; projects lose the client and colliding names become "Name (Client)", then "Name (Client) N".
### #restore
- Open [**JSON restore: idempotent, skips with reasons, keeps archive state**](practice-json-restore-rules.md) — importJsonExport skips records it cannot map with a reason, never replaces a running timer, and re-archives projects after task import.

### #time
- Open [**12-hour time entry: explicit AM/PM wins, ends follow the start**](../web-ui-behaviour/practice-twelve-hour-time-entry-parsing-rules.md) — parseTimeOfDay never overrides a typed AM/PM; unsuffixed ends take the first occurrence after the start; starts guess near now.
- Open [**UI time math uses account-local wall-clock helpers**](../web-ui-behaviour/practice-ui-time-math-uses-wall-clock-helpers.md) — Calendar positions and day/clock shifts use packages/common/time.ts helpers, never +86400000 ms or minutes*60000, so DST days work.
- Open [**Parse incoming timestamps with parseInstant**](practice-parse-api-timestamps-with-parseinstant.md) — Server input instants go through parseInstant: RFC 3339 with seconds and a zone, real dates only. Never new Date(String(x)).

- Open [**Phone layout CSS: position scroll wrappers, min-width: 0, nowrap table identity cells**](../web-ui-styling-and-layout/practice-phone-layout-css-gotchas.md) — Absolute children escape unpositioned scroll wrappers, grid or flex items without min-width: 0 stretch past a phone screen, and wide auto tables wrap every cell.
- Open [**Week calendar hour height lives in three places**](../web-ui-styling-and-layout/practice-week-calendar-hour-height-agrees-in-three-places.md) — HOUR_HEIGHT, the 48px hour lines in styles.css and HOUR in the e2e calendar helpers must match.
