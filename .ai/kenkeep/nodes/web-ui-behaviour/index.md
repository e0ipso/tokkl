# kenkeep Index: web-ui-behaviour

↑ Parent: [kenkeep](../index.md)

> kenkeep navigation: the injected body above is the root index node, the top-level catalog of branches and root-level leaves. Do not expect the whole knowledge base here; descend on demand. Read the root index node, pick one or more branches whose intent and tags match your task (several branches can be relevant), and read those branch `index.md` nodes. Descend further only where the task needs it, opening only the leaves you have confirmed are relevant. Follow each leaf's `relates_to` and `depends_on` cross edges to reach related leaves in other branches. You decide how deep to go per branch.

> This index only orients you; leaves hold the durable guidance. Open at least one relevant leaf before acting.

## Conventions (how we build)
- Open [**UI time math uses account-local wall-clock helpers**](practice-ui-time-math-uses-wall-clock-helpers.md) to learn about: Calendar positions and day/clock shifts use packages/common/time.ts helpers, never +86400000 ms or minutes*60000, so DST days work. #web #time #dst #calendar #common
- Open [**Web UI state must survive background refetches**](practice-web-ui-survives-background-refetches.md) to learn about: Entry rows keep a stable key, the timer bar syncs on every mirrored field, and focus or visibility triggers a refetch. #web #react-query #timer #entry-list
- Open [**12-hour time entry: explicit AM/PM wins, ends follow the start**](practice-twelve-hour-time-entry-parsing-rules.md) to learn about: parseTimeOfDay never overrides a typed AM/PM; unsuffixed ends take the first occurrence after the start; starts guess near now. #web #time #parsing
- Open [**Arrow keys: arrowTarget for roving tabindex; global shortcuts yield**](practice-keyboard-arrow-keys-roving-tabindex-and-own-arrows.md) to learn about: Option groups move focus with arrowTarget and one tab stop; global arrow shortcuts skip defaultPrevented events and \[data-own-arrows\] targets. #web #a11y #keyboard #react #reports
- Open [**Clipboard copy needs a fallback on plain HTTP**](practice-clipboard-copy-needs-http-fallback.md) to learn about: navigator.clipboard exists only on HTTPS or localhost; copy code falls back to a hidden textarea, then asks the user to copy by hand. #web #clipboard #self-hosting

## Components (what exists)
- Open [**Loading, error, empty and field-error states use the shared components**](map-web-page-state-and-field-error-components.md) to learn about: PageState.tsx (Loading, LoadError, BusyRegion), EmptyState.tsx and FieldError.tsx with useFieldErrors; error toasts are role=alert too. #web #a11y #react #components #forms #e2e
