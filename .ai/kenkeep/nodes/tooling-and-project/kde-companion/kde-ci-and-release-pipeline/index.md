↑ Parent: [kde-companion](../index.md)

> kenkeep navigation: the injected body above is the root index node, the top-level catalog of branches and root-level leaves. Do not expect the whole knowledge base here; descend on demand. Read the root index node, pick one or more branches whose intent and tags match your task (several branches can be relevant), and read those branch `index.md` nodes. Descend further only where the task needs it, opening only the leaves you have confirmed are relevant. Follow each leaf's `relates_to` and `depends_on` cross edges to reach related leaves in other branches. You decide how deep to go per branch.

> This index only orients you; leaves hold the durable guidance. Open at least one relevant leaf before acting.

## Components (what exists)
- Open [**KDE and core CI jobs**](map-kde-and-core-ci-jobs.md) to learn about: The kde job builds, tests and checks the DEB and RPM in pinned containers; core checks Qt Core-only links; baseline floors; manual checks. #tooling #kde #ci #packaging
- Open [**Release stages, KDE semantic-release plugin and GNOME assets**](map-release-stages-kde-semantic-release-plugin-and-gnome-assets.md) to learn about: A push to main runs release-version, two kde-release legs, then release; the plugin gates on the manifests; GNOME assets upload after. #tooling #kde #ci #release
- Open [**KDE real-server test**](map-kde-real-server-test.md) to learn about: realservertest.cpp, driven by realserver.test.ts, runs the companion against fixture Tokkl servers behind proxies and checks the data. #tooling #kde #ci #testing
- Open [**Tests for release-only CI steps**](map-tests-for-release-only-ci-steps.md) to learn about: release-publish.test.ts runs ci.yml's publish and version-check steps with a stub gh; other release-only KDE code has node:test files. #tooling #ci #release #testing

## By topic

### #ci
- Open [**KDE real-server test**](map-kde-real-server-test.md) — realservertest.cpp, driven by realserver.test.ts, runs the companion against fixture Tokkl servers behind proxies and checks the data.
- Open [**Release stages, KDE semantic-release plugin and GNOME assets**](map-release-stages-kde-semantic-release-plugin-and-gnome-assets.md) — A push to main runs release-version, two kde-release legs, then release; the plugin gates on the manifests; GNOME assets upload after.
- Open [**Tests for release-only CI steps**](map-tests-for-release-only-ci-steps.md) — release-publish.test.ts runs ci.yml's publish and version-check steps with a stub gh; other release-only KDE code has node:test files.
### #tooling
- Open [**Release stages, KDE semantic-release plugin and GNOME assets**](map-release-stages-kde-semantic-release-plugin-and-gnome-assets.md) — A push to main runs release-version, two kde-release legs, then release; the plugin gates on the manifests; GNOME assets upload after.
- Open [**KDE and core CI jobs**](map-kde-and-core-ci-jobs.md) — The kde job builds, tests and checks the DEB and RPM in pinned containers; core checks Qt Core-only links; baseline floors; manual checks.
- Open [**desktop/core and desktop/kde: CMake projects, libraries and QML types**](../plasma-companion/map-desktop-core-and-desktop-kde-cmake-projects-libraries-and-qml-types.md) — tokklcore is Qt-only in desktop/core; tokklkde adds KWallet, the applet Pomodoro store and the KDE wiring; QML_FOREIGN types; version and README.
### #kde
- Open [**KDE panel: button, menu and project indicator**](../plasma-companion/map-kde-panel-button-menu-and-project-indicator.md) — PanelButton and PanelMenu: clicks and keys, the Start or Stop item, the Open Tokkl URL, and the project indicator's shapes and pulse.
- Open [**KDE timer controller: server-derived time, one mutation, no replayed starts**](../practice-kde-timer-controller-rules.md) — TokklTimer shows the server's timer state, derives elapsed from the server start and clock, runs one mutation at a time and never replays a write; the pause chain and sessions are the server's; the project is locked while running or paused.
- Open [**desktop/core and desktop/kde: CMake projects, libraries and QML types**](../plasma-companion/map-desktop-core-and-desktop-kde-cmake-projects-libraries-and-qml-types.md) — tokklcore is Qt-only in desktop/core; tokklkde adds KWallet, the applet Pomodoro store and the KDE wiring; QML_FOREIGN types; version and README.
### #release
- Open [**Release stages, KDE semantic-release plugin and GNOME assets**](map-release-stages-kde-semantic-release-plugin-and-gnome-assets.md) — A push to main runs release-version, two kde-release legs, then release; the plugin gates on the manifests; GNOME assets upload after.
- Open [**KDE native packaging: DEB, RPM and the version mapping**](../map-kde-native-packaging.md) — tokkl-kde DEB and RPM are built and checked only in containers; scripts/native-version.sh is the one version mapping.
- Open [**KDE release upgrade check: previous-package.sh and --previous-package**](../map-kde-release-upgrade-check-from-the-published-predecessor.md) — Release legs upgrade from the newest older published tokkl-kde asset, checked by size and SHA-256, or from a 0.0.0 build when none is usable.
### #testing
- Open [**E2E isolation: worker accounts, the reset fixture and the error guard**](../../testing/e2e-suite/practice-e2e-isolation-worker-accounts-the-reset-fixture-and-the-error-guard.md) — Each worker has its own admin; the data fixture wipes that user's data; runtimeErrors fails tests unless a spec allows the failure.
- Open [**Writing e2e specs: areas, shared helpers and extra accounts**](../../testing/e2e-suite/practice-writing-e2e-specs-areas-shared-helpers-and-extra-accounts.md) — Specs live by area with per-area helpers; ReportApi, transfer fixtures, disposable servers, the users fixture and login.
- Open [**Running the e2e suite: build, Chromium, ports and the data directory**](../../testing/e2e-suite/practice-running-the-e2e-suite-build-chromium-ports-and-the-data-directory.md) — test:e2e builds first; desktop runs in parallel and instance on one worker; E2E_PORT per run; a preset data dir is locked.
### #packaging
- Open [**KDE native packaging: DEB, RPM and the version mapping**](../map-kde-native-packaging.md) — tokkl-kde DEB and RPM are built and checked only in containers; scripts/native-version.sh is the one version mapping.
- Open [**KDE release upgrade check: previous-package.sh and --previous-package**](../map-kde-release-upgrade-check-from-the-published-predecessor.md) — Release legs upgrade from the newest older published tokkl-kde asset, checked by size and SHA-256, or from a 0.0.0 build when none is usable.
- Open [**KDE and core CI jobs**](map-kde-and-core-ci-jobs.md) — The kde job builds, tests and checks the DEB and RPM in pinned containers; core checks Qt Core-only links; baseline floors; manual checks.
