# kenkeep Index: tooling-and-project / kde-companion

↑ Parent: [tooling-and-project](../index.md)

> kenkeep navigation: the injected body above is the root index node, the top-level catalog of branches and root-level leaves. Do not expect the whole knowledge base here; descend on demand. Read the root index node, pick one or more branches whose intent and tags match your task (several branches can be relevant), and read those branch `index.md` nodes. Descend further only where the task needs it, opening only the leaves you have confirmed are relevant. Follow each leaf's `relates_to` and `depends_on` cross edges to reach related leaves in other branches. You decide how deep to go per branch.

> This index only orients you; leaves hold the durable guidance. Open at least one relevant leaf before acting.

## Subfolders
- Load [`connection-and-credentials/`](connection-and-credentials/index.md) for more information on the KDE companion's HTTP client, access kinds, settings generations, credential stores and Configure page; read before changing desktop connection, auth, KWallet or configGeneral.qml code.
- Load [`plasma-companion/`](plasma-companion/index.md) for more information on the desktop/core and desktop/kde projects, the panel UI and the CTest suite; read before changing desktop CMake, panel QML or desktop tests.

## Conventions (how we build)
- Open [**KDE timer controller: server-derived time, one mutation, no replayed starts**](practice-kde-timer-controller-rules.md) to learn about: TokklTimer derives elapsed from the server start, polls 30 s, runs one mutation at a time, never replays a start, gates writes on a known entry; the project is locked while running, billable edits it with a partial PUT. #kde #desktop

## Components (what exists)
- Open [**KDE CI job and release: kde matrix, real-server test, semantic-release plugin**](map-kde-ci-and-release-pipeline.md) to learn about: The kde CI job builds, tests and checks the DEB and RPM in pinned containers; the release builds them again and attaches both to the v<version> release. #tooling #kde #ci #release
- Open [**KDE native packaging: DEB, RPM and the version mapping**](map-kde-native-packaging.md) to learn about: tokkl-kde DEB and RPM are built and checked only in containers; scripts/native-version.sh is the one version mapping. #tooling #kde #packaging #release

## By topic

### #kde
- Open [**KDE panel: button, menu and project indicator**](plasma-companion/map-kde-panel-button-menu-and-project-indicator.md) — PanelButton and PanelMenu wiring, keyboard and mouse bindings, Open Tokkl URL, and the project indicator's ring, pulse and reduced motion.
- Open [**KDE timer controller: server-derived time, one mutation, no replayed starts**](practice-kde-timer-controller-rules.md) — TokklTimer derives elapsed from the server start, polls 30 s, runs one mutation at a time, never replays a start, gates writes on a known entry; the project is locked while running, billable edits it with a partial PUT.
- Open [**desktop/core and desktop/kde: CMake projects, libraries and QML types**](plasma-companion/map-desktop-core-and-desktop-kde-cmake-projects-libraries-and-qml-types.md) — tokklcore is Qt-only in desktop/core; tokklkde adds KWallet; QML_FOREIGN types; version from root package.json; README guide.
### #release
- Open [**KDE CI job and release: kde matrix, real-server test, semantic-release plugin**](map-kde-ci-and-release-pipeline.md) — The kde CI job builds, tests and checks the DEB and RPM in pinned containers; the release builds them again and attaches both to the v<version> release.
- Open [**KDE native packaging: DEB, RPM and the version mapping**](map-kde-native-packaging.md) — tokkl-kde DEB and RPM are built and checked only in containers; scripts/native-version.sh is the one version mapping.
- Open [**Container image ghcr.io/e0ipso/tokkl**](../map-container-image-ghcr-io-e0ipso-tokkl.md) — Multi-arch image built from the root Dockerfile and pushed by the CI release job when semantic-release tags; writes only to /data.
### #tooling
- Open [**GNOME timer service: tokkl-timerd and org.tokkl.Timer1**](../map-gnome-timerd-d-bus-timer-service.md) — tokkl-timerd is a headless Qt service on the shared core; D-Bus contract rules, activation and the check.sh container.
- Open [**GNOME Shell extension: panel button, versions and the two CI harnesses**](../map-gnome-shell-extension-for-tokkl-timerd.md) — desktop/gnome/extension drives tokkl-timerd; Shell 46-51; Shell 50 click gesture; check.sh mock harness, realservice.sh real service.
- Open [**desktop/core and desktop/kde: CMake projects, libraries and QML types**](plasma-companion/map-desktop-core-and-desktop-kde-cmake-projects-libraries-and-qml-types.md) — tokklcore is Qt-only in desktop/core; tokklkde adds KWallet; QML_FOREIGN types; version from root package.json; README guide.
### #ci
- Open [**GNOME timer service: tokkl-timerd and org.tokkl.Timer1**](../map-gnome-timerd-d-bus-timer-service.md) — tokkl-timerd is a headless Qt service on the shared core; D-Bus contract rules, activation and the check.sh container.

- Open [**macOS menu bar app: portable library, Objective-C++ shims and CI**](../map-macos-menu-bar-app.md) — desktop/macos splits a Linux-testable Qt library from three macOS-only shims; why NSStatusItem; what the macos CI job covers.
### #desktop
- Open [**KDE panel: button, menu and project indicator**](plasma-companion/map-kde-panel-button-menu-and-project-indicator.md) — PanelButton and PanelMenu wiring, keyboard and mouse bindings, Open Tokkl URL, and the project indicator's ring, pulse and reduced motion.
- Open [**KDE timer controller: server-derived time, one mutation, no replayed starts**](practice-kde-timer-controller-rules.md) — TokklTimer derives elapsed from the server start, polls 30 s, runs one mutation at a time, never replays a start, gates writes on a known entry; the project is locked while running, billable edits it with a partial PUT.
