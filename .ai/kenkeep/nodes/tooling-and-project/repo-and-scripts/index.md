# kenkeep Index: tooling-and-project / repo-and-scripts

↑ Parent: [tooling-and-project](../index.md)

> kenkeep navigation: the injected body above is the root index node, the top-level catalog of branches and root-level leaves. Do not expect the whole knowledge base here; descend on demand. Read the root index node, pick one or more branches whose intent and tags match your task (several branches can be relevant), and read those branch `index.md` nodes. Descend further only where the task needs it, opening only the leaves you have confirmed are relevant. Follow each leaf's `relates_to` and `depends_on` cross edges to reach related leaves in other branches. You decide how deep to go per branch.

> This index only orients you; leaves hold the durable guidance. Open at least one relevant leaf before acting.

## Conventions (how we build)
- Open [**Commit messages: Conventional Commits, no co-author or AI trailers**](practice-commit-messages-pass-commitlint-no-ai-generated.md) to learn about: commitlint rejects Co-authored-by and AI trailers, ticket IDs in headers and subjects over 72 chars; worktrees without npm ci skip the hook. #tooling #workflow #git
- Open [**Keep Sift ticket IDs and Strikethroo plans out of code and public docs**](practice-keep-sift-ticket-ids-and-strikethroo-plans-out-of-code-and-public-docs.md) to learn about: TT-NNNN IDs and plan references stay in .ai/sift and .ai/strikethroo; code, comments, tests, docs and commit subjects state the fact. CI enforces it. #tooling #docs #comments #commits #sift #strikethroo
- Open [**Do not mark commits as breaking changes**](practice-do-not-mark-commits-as-breaking-changes.md) to learn about: Commits and PR titles carry no \`!\` or \`BREAKING CHANGE:\` footer, so semantic-release never cuts a major release, even for behavior changes. #release #git #semantic-release #workflow
- Open [**Keep TrueNAS install steps out of the repo README**](practice-keep-truenas-install-steps-out-of-the-repo-readme.md) to learn about: The README documents generic Docker use only. Install steps for TrueNAS or other NAS admin screens stay out of the repo. #docs #readme #deployment #truenas
- Open [**Merge a PR stack bottom-up without retargeting its PRs**](practice-merge-a-pr-stack-bottom-up-without-retargeting-its-prs.md) to learn about: Merge stacked PRs bottom-up, starting with the one based on main. Don't repoint upper PR bases or close and reopen PRs. #git #github #pull-requests #workflow
- Open [**README describes the current project, never its history**](practice-readme-describes-the-current-project-never-its-history.md) to learn about: README.md documents how Tokkl works now. No rename story, upgrade-from-old-name sections, audit dates or how-we-got-here notes. #docs #readme

## Components (what exists)
- Open [**npm workspaces: packages/common, packages/api, packages/web, packages/types**](map-npm-workspaces-package-layout.md) to learn about: Four @tokkl workspaces; common and types ship raw .ts; run scripts from the root; npm install per worktree. #monorepo #workspaces #layout #tooling #common #api #web #types
- Open [**README screenshots: npm run screenshots**](map-readme-screenshots-script.md) to learn about: scripts/screenshots.ts rebuilds the ten docs/screenshots PNGs on a frozen clock; SQLite unixepoch('now') ignores it, so the timer stops. #tooling #docs #screenshots #playwright
- Open [**Brand images: npm run icons derives every served file from docs/brand**](map-app-icons-script.md) to learn about: scripts/icons.ts resizes the owner's PNG artwork in docs/brand with ImageMagick 7 into the served icons and wordmark, and copies the maskable and apple-touch icons as supplied. #tooling #pwa #icons #imagemagick #maskable #web
- Open [**Old Timetrack names still accepted after the Tokkl rename**](map-tokkl-rename-legacy-name-fallbacks.md) to learn about: Old Timetrack env vars, database file, cookie, CSRF header, theme key and export format still work. #server #web #config #rename
